# How to manage your photos?

## Why I need to manage your photo?

Currently, I have over 700 GB photo in my drive. I need to take the risk of losing them if my drive fail. So that I need to find out a way to safely manage ( backup ) my photos.

## The Potentail Solution
### Amazon Cloud Drive
[Amazon cloud drive](https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/pricing?ref_=cd_home_navpricing) provide 12 for unlimited photos and 60 for unlimited everything.
**Pros:**
1. Free and Unlimited cloud drive for photo (include raw) since I am a prime member.
**Cons:**
1. Bad User Interface
2. Cannot automatically sync

### Google Drive

### Microsoft OneDrive
